// hello, we are here to present veisty. an item manager for bungie's destiny games.
// an interesting thing about bungie's api, even though it is publicly avaiible,
// there is no official support.
// on top of the lack of support, many parts of the api only work in tandem with
// sony or microsoft, or in 2's case blizzard. as destiny is on those companies
// platforms, and also utilize their online networks.
// so there are two layers of apis and authentification, and getting these to
// cooperate was very challenging.

// fortunately, the whole bungie api is not inaccessible. some functions
// like moving and equiping items, which are post requests, only work when logged
// we can access some functionality without logging in. through a string of get
// requests, from psn name and platformid, to membershipid, charactersid, and a final
// get with said players character's id, we can get those items.

// for instance, to get my character's gear, unless i have my 'id' which is called
// 'destinymembershipid' in the api handy, i need to search by user. from username,
// and platform, we can find said id, then our characters info.
// with sony or microsoft's api, that one auth login allows access to bungie's servers
// and databases

// pass to aaron; showcase frontend. omparisons, loadouts, statistical analysis

// pass back to me; conclusion: 'and that's that, it's a work in progress still, but
// that's veisty so far'
